# Key Findings and Suggestions:

Identified Fluctuations in Load Factors:

Significant fluctuations in passenger and cargo load factors were observed, particularly in April, June, July, and August.
These fluctuations may indicate operational disruptions or seasonal trends affecting airline performance.
Optimize Resource Allocation:

During months with low load factors, it is advisable to reallocate resources to improve efficiency.
For instance, reducing the number of flights or adjusting the fleet size during off-peak periods can help in minimizing operational costs.
Strategic Marketing and Promotions:

Implement targeted marketing efforts and promotional campaigns during off-peak months to boost passenger and cargo load factors.
Offering discounts or special packages can attract more customers and enhance load factors during these periods.
